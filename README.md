# Eat-Da-Burger!
A burger logger app created by: following the MVC design pattern; using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data as well as Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Overview 
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets you input the name of every possible burger you'd like to eat and store it in the database. Whenever the user submits a burger's name, ther app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be "devoured." Each burger in the waiting area has a `Devour it!` button which, when the user clicks, will move the burger to the right side of the page.
